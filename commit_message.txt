feat(tenants): Refactor tenant management UI

This commit refactors the tenant management UI to improve user experience and code maintainability.

- A dedicated page (`TenantFormPage.js`) has been created for creating and editing tenants, replacing the previous modal-based approach.
- New routes (`/superadmin/tenants/new` and `/superadmin/tenants/edit/:id`) have been added for the tenant form page.
- The `TenantList.js` component has been updated to use the `DataGrid` component from `@mui/x-data-grid`, providing out-of-the-box sorting, filtering, and pagination.
- The old `TenantForm.js` component has been removed.
- The `@mui/x-data-grid` package has been added as a dependency.
