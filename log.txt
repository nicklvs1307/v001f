90.21 Module not found: Error: Can't resolve '@mui/material/styles' in '/app/node_modules/@mui/x-date-pickers/esm/DatePicker'
90.21 Did you mean 'index.js'?
90.21 BREAKING CHANGE: The request '@mui/material/styles' failed to resolve only because it was resolved as fully specified
90.21 (probably because the origin is strict EcmaScript Module, e. g. a module with javascript mimetype, a '*.mjs' file, or a '*.js' file where the package.json contains '"type": "module"').
90.21 The extension in the request is mandatory for it to be fully specified.
90.21 Add the extension to the request.
