92.59 Did you mean 'index.js'?
92.59 BREAKING CHANGE: The request '@mui/material/styles' failed to resolve only because it was resolved as fully specified
92.59 (probably because the origin is strict EcmaScript Module, e. g. a module with javascript mimetype, a '*.mjs' file, or a '*.js' file where the package.json contains '"type": "module"').
92.59 The extension in the request is mandatory for it to be fully specified.
92.59 Add the extension to the request.

90.21 Did you mean 'index.js'?
90.21 BREAKING CHANGE: The request '@mui/material/styles' failed to resolve only because it was resolved as fully specified
90.21 (probably because the origin is strict EcmaScript Module, e. g. a module with javascript mimetype, a '*.mjs' file, or a '*.js' file where the package.json contains '"type": "module"').
90.21 The extension in the request is mandatory for it to be fully specified.
90.21 Add the extension to the request.

npm WARN deprecated abab@2.0.6: Use your platform's native atob() and btoa() methods instead
npm WARN deprecated rimraf@3.0.2: Rimraf versions prior to v4 are no longer supported

npm WARN deprecated q@1.5.1: You or someone you depend on is using Q, the JavaScript Promise library that gave JavaScript developers strong feelings about promises. They can almost certainly migrate to the native JavaScript promise now. Thank you literally everyone for joining me in this bet against the odds. Be excellent to each other.
npm WARN deprecated
npm WARN deprecated (For a CapTP with native promises, see @endo/eventual-send and @endo/captp)

86.38 Module not found: Error: Can't resolve '@mui/material/styles' in '/app/node_modules/@mui/x-date-pickers/esm/LocalizationProvider'
86.38 Did you mean 'index.js'?
86.38 BREAKING CHANGE: The request '@mui/material/styles' failed to resolve only because it was resolved as fully specified
86.38 (probably because the origin is strict EcmaScript Module, e. g. a module with javascript mimetype, a '*.mjs' file, or a '*.js' file where the package.json contains '"type": "module"').
86.38 The extension in the request is mandatory for it to be fully specified.
86.38 Add the extension to the request.
