fix(frontend): Correct import paths

This commit fixes a build error caused by incorrect import paths in several components. The error "Module not found: Error: You attempted to import which falls outside of the project src/ directory" was occurring because of relative imports going up too many levels.

The following files have been updated with the correct import paths:
- `frontend/src/pages/TenantFormPage.js`
- `frontend/src/components/tenants/TenantList.js`
- `frontend/src/pages/UserFormPage.js`
