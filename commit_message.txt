fix(frontend): Correct relative import paths again

This commit rectifies persistent build errors related to module not found. Previously, an attempt was made to use absolute import paths, which was incorrect due to the project's Webpack/CRA configuration not supporting them without explicit setup.

This commit reverts the import paths in the following files to correct relative paths, ensuring proper module resolution during the build process:
- `frontend/src/pages/TenantFormPage.js`
- `frontend/src/components/tenants/TenantList.js`
- `frontend/src/pages/UserFormPage.js`
