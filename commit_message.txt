feat(users): Refactor user management UI

This commit refactors the user management UI to improve user experience and code maintainability.

- A dedicated page (`UserFormPage.js`) has been created for creating and editing users, replacing the previous modal-based approach.
- New routes (`/dashboard/usuarios/new` and `/dashboard/usuarios/edit/:id`) have been added for the user form page.
- The `UserList.js` component has been updated to use the `DataGrid` component from `@mui/x-data-grid`, providing out-of-the-box sorting, filtering, and pagination.
- The old `UserModal.js` component has been removed.
