feat(campaigns): Implement specific and birthday client selection

This commit enhances the campaign creation functionality by adding support for 'specific' and 'birthday' client selection criteria.

Backend:
- The `_selectClients` function in `campanhaService.js` has been updated to handle `criterio.type === 'specific'` and `criterio.type === 'birthday'`.

Frontend:
- `ClientSegmentSelector.js` has been updated to include 'Specific Clients' and 'Birthday Month' as selectable options.
- `CampaignFormPage.js` now conditionally renders a multi-select dropdown for specific clients or a month selector for birthday campaigns.
- The page now fetches all clients to populate the specific client selector.
- The state management has been updated to handle `clientIds` and `month` in the `criterioSelecao` object.
