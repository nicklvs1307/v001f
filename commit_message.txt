fix(frontend): Use absolute import paths to resolve build error

This commit fixes a build error caused by incorrect relative import paths in several components. The error "Module not found: Error: Can't resolve" was occurring because of issues with relative path resolution during the build process.

The following files have been updated to use absolute import paths from the `src` directory, which is a more robust approach:
- `frontend/src/pages/TenantFormPage.js`
- `frontend/src/components/tenants/TenantList.js`
- `frontend/src/pages/UserFormPage.js`
